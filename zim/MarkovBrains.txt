===== Presentation =====

==== introduce Mr Thompson's research ====
In 1996 Dr Thompson used genetic algorithms to program a FPGA to recognize sounds ...


===== Markov Brains =====
Markov Brains are a class of evolvable artificial neural networks.
structure encoded in genome

state buffer <- hidden, input, and output states

updates happen in parallel

one world update can contain many brain updates

==== Gates: ====

=== Deterministic Logic ===

=== Probabilistic Logic ===

=== ANN Gate ===

=== Threshold Gate ===

=== Timer Gate ===
returns ones after a predetermined number of updates have elapsed

=== Feedback Gate ===

=== Ternary Logic Gate ===

different start codons signal different types of gate
