====== Part I: Basics ======

===== Chapter 1: Introduction =====

Crossover: randomly combine selected parents
Mutation: randomly alter selected program

{{{code: lang="python" linenumbers="True"
Randomly create initial population of programs from the available primitives
repeat:
	Execute each program and ascertain its fitness
	Select one or two+ program(s)from the population with a probability based on fitness to participate in genetic operations
	Create new individual program(s) by applying genetic operations with specific probabilities
until an acceptable solution is found or some other stopping condition is met (eg: a max number of generations is reached)
return the best-so-far individual
}}}


===== Chapter 2: Representation, Initialisation and Operators in Tree-based GP =====

==== 2.1: Representation ====
GP programs are represented as syntax trees (often represented as linear sequences to increase performance)

==== 2.2: Initialising the Population ====

=== - full: ===
create a full tree taking random nodes from the functions set until maxdepth is reached, then fill leaves with values
cons: uniform trees

=== - grow: ===
nodes are selected from both primitives and terminals, therefore a branch can be shorter than maxdepth
cons: tree shape is dependent on ratio of functions/values. too many values = shorter tree.

=== - ramped half and half: ===
use a range of depth limit to generate a tree with various sizes and shapes

==== 2.3: Selection ====
- tournaments between two random invididuals determine each of the two parents: no sudden change in genetic makeup / diversity
- several other methods including fitness-proportionate selection, stochastic universal sampling, etc

==== 2.4: Recombination and Mutation ====
- GP uses subtree crossover: select a crossover point (node) in each parent, create a copy of first parent and replace post-crossover point subtree by that of the second parent
- Multiple possible offsprings for the same parents pair
- To avoid exchanging too small amount of information, we may force the crossover point to be a function rather than a leave most of the time.
- Mutation: can apply small mutation probability to each node
When crossover and mutation < 100%, we use reproduction to insert copies of current individuals to make up the whole generation.

===== Chapter 3: Getting Ready to Run Genetic Programming =====

==== 3.1: Step 1: Terminal Set ====
- The program's external inputs (named variables)
- Functions with no arguments (eg: random, position, func w/ side effects)
- Constants (pre-specified, randomly generated w/ tree creation, through mutation)

==== 3.2: Step 2: Function Set ====
examples: Arithmetic (+,-,*,/), Mathematical (sin, cos, exp), Boolean (and, or, not), Conditional (if-then-else), Looping (for, repeat)

=== 3.2.1: Closure ===
Type consistency is required to mix and join nodes arbitrarily
Solutions:
* type consistency
* automatic type conversion
* require replacement subtrees to have matching type
Errors must either be caught (with a penalty) or inputs must be sanitized appropriately

=== 3.2.2 Sufficiency ===
The set of primitives must contain necessary functions, otherwise the resulting function can only be an approximation of the correct solution.

=== 3.2.3 Evolving structures other than programs ===
We may model real-life design problems using components (such as resistors, capacitors, ... in analog circuits) as the function set and the design's various outputs as terminal sets

==== 3.3 Step 3: Fitness Function ====
The fitness function is what directs the program population in the right direction. It is typically a score based on one or more of the following: accuracy, error-rate, run-time, efficiency.
An interpreter is commonly used to run the programs (syntax trees) with multiple inputs.

==== 3.4 Step 4: GP Parameters ====
Some important parameters include the population size, probability of performing a genetic operation, and the maximum program size.
There are no universally optimal parameters, but many different parameters will typically work.
Population size is typically limited by run-time (not memory).
Optimal/useful results are typically found within 10-50 generations

==== 3.5 Step 5: Termination and solution designaton ====
Breeding stops when a preset maximum number of generations has been reached, or a satisfying solution has been found.
Typically the single healthiest individual is returned, but some use-cases may require multiple solutions.

===== Chapter 4: Example Genetic Programming Run =====
The goal of this example run is to "evolve an expression whose values match those of the quadratic polynomial x^{2}+x+1 in the range [-1, +1]

	(small population size to keep example manageable)


==== 4.2 Step-by-step sample run ====

=== 4.2.1 Initialisation ===
Initial population:
* (x + 1 ) -  0
* 1 + ( x * x)
* 2 + 0
* x  * ( -1 - -2)

=== 4.2.2 Fitness Evaluation ===
We use the sum of absolute errors for x ∈ {−1.0, −0.9, . . . 0.9, 1.0}

=== 4.2.3 Selection, Crossover and Mutation ===
We select individuals probabilistically, so that the healthier programs are more likely but not guaranteed to be selected for breeding, and the weaker ones may still reproduce. (not a greedy approach)
We copy a parent and select a random node that is replaced by a random node from the other parent.
