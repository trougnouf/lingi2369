#Genetic Algorithms

start a genepool that consists of individuals made out of random bits
each individual is assigned a score based on how it performs on a given task
each subsequent generation is made of surviving individuals, mutated ones, and offsprings of other individuals. Survival rate and mating selection is influenced (but not dictated) by the individual's score
run a predetermined number of iterations or until a given score threshold is met



## Application

timetabling and scheduling problems
	mixed population = move away from local optima
engineering
	antenna

	
this applies 

# Genetic programming

GA work with bitstrings
extand to program instructions!
